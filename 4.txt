I created a Stack class with the following features :
 1 - Stack
 2 - isEmpty
 3 - isFull
 4 - getSize
 5 - printAll
 6 - push
 7 - pop
 8 - update

The stack has 2 private attributes 
 1 - data : array of chars.
 2 - size : integer (the current size of the stack)
 

------------------------Details -------------------------------------------------

Stack    : Constructor that initializes the stack.

isEmpty  : public function that returns True if the size of the stack is 0.

isFull   : public function that returns True if the size of the stack = MAX_SIZE
           Note : MAZ_SIZE is defined in the top of stack.h file and can be modified.

getSize  : public function that returns the current size of the stack.

printAll : public function that prints out all elements of the stack.

push     : public function that inserts a new item at the top of the stack.
           Note : it increases the size of the stack by 1
                  if the stack is full it returns False

pop      : public function that returns the top most element of the stack and remove it.
           Note : it decreases the size of the stack by 1
                  if the stack is full it returns '~'.

Update   : public function that updates the value of an index in the stack.
           Note :  if the pos is not in the stack it returns False.
